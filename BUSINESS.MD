# Business Plan: Watchman

## 1. Value Proposition

Watchman provides web3 game developers with a powerful and intuitive analytics platform to monitor, analyze, and manage their in-game economies. By offering real-time insights into key economic metrics and the ability to adjust parameters on the fly, Watchman helps developers prevent economic imbalances, enhance player engagement, and ensure the long-term sustainability and profitability of their games.

## 2. Target Group

Our primary target group is web3 game developers and studios, ranging from small indie teams to larger, established gaming companies that are building on or migrating to blockchain-based platforms. This includes game designers, economy managers, and product leads who are responsible for the health and performance of the in-game economy.

## 3. Revenue Streams

We will adopt a tiered SaaS subscription model:

*   **Free Tier:** For hobbyists and small projects, offering basic analytics for a limited number of players.
*   **Pro Tier:** For professional studios, offering advanced analytics, real-time alerts, and parameter adjustment capabilities.
*   **Enterprise Tier:** For large-scale games, offering dedicated support, custom integrations, and advanced economic modeling/simulation services.

## 4. Costs

*   **Development & Personnel:** Salaries for blockchain developers, frontend engineers, and a business development/marketing lead.
*   **Infrastructure:** Costs for servers, databases, and running zkSync nodes.
*   **Marketing & Sales:** Expenses related to content marketing, conference sponsorships, and community building.
*   **Operational Costs:** Legal, administrative, and tooling expenses.

## 5. Mini Business Plan MVP

*   **Project Name:** Watchman
*   **One-Liner:** The essential analytics and control panel for building and maintaining sustainable web2-web3 game economies.
*   **Problem:** In-game economies are fragile. Without sophisticated monitoring and management tools, developers risk hyperinflation, asset devaluation, and player churn, which can destroy a game's long-term viability.
*   **Our Solution:** Watchman offers a comprehensive dashboard to track critical economic indicators (e.g., token sinks/faucets, inflation rates, asset distribution). It leverages zkSync to allow developers to affordably and efficiently adjust on-chain game parameters, such as loot drop rates and monthly item caps, to maintain a balanced economy.
*   **Target Users:** Web2-Web3 game developers, game designers, and economy managers.
